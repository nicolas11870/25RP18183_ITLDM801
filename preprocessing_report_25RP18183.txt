PREPROCESSING REPORT - ITLDM801 CAT
Student Registration Number: 25RP18183
Date: 20-February-2026
Dataset: Rwanda Polytechnic Graduates Classification
=================================================================

1. ORIGINAL DATASET
   - File: rp_students_20000.csv
   - Records: 20,000
   - Features: 10 (Student_ID, 6 subjects, Total_Score, Percentage, Class)

2. DATA ISSUES INTRODUCED
   a) Missing Values: ~1.5% injected in Machine_learning, Data_mining, Cyber_security (~300 values each)
   b) Duplicates: 200 duplicate rows added (dataset grew to 20,200 rows)
   c) Outliers: 120 extreme values (150 or -20) injected into random subject columns
   d) Noise: Gaussian noise (mean=0, std=0.5) added to Machine_learning scores of 800 records
   e) Inconsistencies: 150 Student_ID records modified with mixed case and extra spaces

3. CLEANING METHODS APPLIED
   a) Missing Values: Median imputation for Machine_learning, Data_mining, Cyber_security
      - Justification: Median is robust to extreme outlier values
   b) Duplicates: Identified and removed all duplicate rows using drop_duplicates()
   c) Outliers: Clipped all subject scores to valid range [0, 100]
   d) Inconsistencies: Student_ID standardized using strip().upper()

4. FEATURE ENGINEERING
   - MinMaxScaler applied to 6 subject columns -> _scaled features created
   - Decimal scaling applied to Data_mining -> Data_mining_decimal_scaled
   - Total_Score recalculated as sum of 6 subjects
   - Percentage recalculated as (Total_Score / 600) * 100
   - Class assigned based on percentage thresholds
   - Percentage_Bin created for discrete performance grouping

5. DATASET SIZE COMPARISON
   - Before preprocessing (after injections): 20,200 rows x 10 columns
   - After preprocessing (cleaned): ~20,000 rows (duplicates removed)
   - Final feature count: 10 original + scaled features + derived features

6. DATA QUALITY OUTCOME
   - Missing values: 0 remaining
   - Duplicates: 0 remaining
   - Out-of-range scores: 0 remaining
   - Student_ID format: Standardized (uppercase, no spaces)
